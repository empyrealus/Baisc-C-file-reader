# Baisc C++ file reader for console reading
 This program has been created to view the content in a file based upon a specified limit.  That specified limit is then used to allow a user to navigate through a file progressively  by entering yes.     This program will give you various amount of information such as your file size, your browsing position,  your current page number, how many pages there are, and lastly this program will display the content of each  successive yes.   Note: The first result will not return anything as I start from 0. Please enter 'y' to continue  to match your first result and consecutive results.

Problem:
Console Based file reading methods by default output a large chunk of text that's not progressively accessible. You may not be able to read the 
entirety of a file that's output into the console, if that's what you wish to do for whatever reason. 

Solution:
This program allows you to index and tab your way through a file progressively from beginning to end, in the console.
